        Are we just goin\u2019 in to hit a big red button that says \u2018self-destruct\u2019
        or something?"

        With all those bodies in its control, I presume its power core will be well
        protected.

        every few years to allow me to continue on indefinitely. But it had plans
        of its own. It determined that humanity could not exist within its vision
        of a perfect world, and that genocide was the only solution."
